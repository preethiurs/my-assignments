what is redux?
Redux provides a predictable state container.
view the entire state of your application
derive the ui from this state
see how the actions modify the state of your application



immutable data structure
create new structure whenever we updates 
it will share the common memory area

transit js 

used to serialize anything


how to use redux for state representation

keep the data in the way which u like for ex : array, immutable data structure etc
using reducers we can modify the data
using suscribers propagate the data to all over the application


pure and impure functions
pure : returned value depends only on the parameters,no side effects in d sense it will not update the data
